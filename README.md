## Temporal Relations and Relationship Extraction for Clinical Text

    Our goal is the use NLP techniques to extract information from clinical text and determine relationships between tokens/words. We are specifically
    looking at the **N2C2** data set, ["_2012 Temporal Relations Challenge_"](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/).

    To start, we will examine recent papers on this topic (preferably with code included) and see if we can replicate their results. There is also
    scope to test these results against existing technology (amazon comprehend etc), do so with caution.
